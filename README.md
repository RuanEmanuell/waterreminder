## Water Reminder

This project is a simple Water Reminder, but I learned a lot from it. In this project I learned to manage persistant data (with Hive), send app notifications (with Awesome Notifications), I also learned a lot about other things (such as in-app translation and dark mode) and it was great to increase my Flutter skills overall. It is also my first app to be available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruanemanuell.water_reminder">Google Play</a>, and this was great to learn about this process too.

PS: This project first started in 2022, but was updated in early 2024.

    The new version includes:
     - Removing cup from daily history
     - Custom daily water intake goal
     - Calendar of past days
     - Ads for monetization
    
### How to Run

You will need <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter</a>, after booting up on your emulator or device and <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab">starting a new Flutter project</a>, you will transfer the files of this repository folder of your Flutter project. As the project started in 2022, it will be necessary to roll back to an 
older version of Flutter (v 3.13.9). Some other adjustments in other directories may also be necessary due to incompatibility.
